2,"CNN —You may have heard of atmospheric rivers impacting the West Coast.
Apparently, atmospheric rivers also occur in the eastern US, unleashing a river of moisture like what we will see this week.
The reason East Coast atmospheric rivers aren’t talked about much isn’t because they are rare.
The West gets about half that number of atmospheric rivers each year, yet they account for double the annual rainfall percentage.

Their results, published in 2020 in the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences, managed to quantify how effective cloud seeding is.

The CSU forecast called for 19 named storms, nine hurricanes and four major storms.
However, during the announcement, NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad recognized that the current hurricane cycle for the Atlantic is a busy one.
“If you go back two years, the 2020 hurricane season broke records across the board and it’s the most active season on record with 30 named storms,” said Spinrad.

But have you ever noticed hurricane hunters’ flight patterns shown by meteorologists on TV look like random, odd shapes?
Hurricane hunters don’t fly away from these storms like commercial airlines do.
There are two distinctive groups of hurricane hunters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US Air Force Reserve (USAF).

It has already been a dreadful year for wildfires.
More than 14,781 separate wildfires have scorched over half a million acres as of this week, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, the largest number of fires year-to-date the agency has recorded in the past decade.

14,"Scott Cunningham/Getty Images“Sometimes, it may appear that a storm is in a perfect environment for a tornado to form, yet it never does.
The updrafts and downdrafts work in tandem to pull the horizontal column of air down to form the tornado.
“The most telltale sign that a tornado could be forming, when you are looking at a close-range severe thunderstorm, is the ‘wall cloud,’” says Miller.
The wall cloud is a lowering of the cloud base that will lead to the vortex, or spinning of air.
The presence of a wall cloud doesn’t always mean a tornado will form, but it certainly ups the odds.",0.07437169312169313
